## Getting Started

*  Install with npm: `npm install -g jira-cl-plus`
*  Run it with `jira [command] [arguments]`

### Initial Setup
When running the first time (or if you didn't create a config file), it will ask you for your Jira host, username, password and if you use 'https' protocol and a new config file will be created in `~/.jira-cli.json` with this data. You can create or modify this file manually.
